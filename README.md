# Simply Social
A web application code challenge built using Gulp, Panini, Sass and standards-based HTML & CSS (and a bit of JavaScript too).

*Note: This project uses Gulp 4.0. To run it, you'll need to install Gulp 4 globally but can run older versions of Gulp locally.*

To remove previous versions of Gulp:

    $ npm rm -g gulp

Install Gulp globally (to provide access to the Gulp CLI):

    $ npm install -g gulp-cli

In terminal, `cd` into the `simply-social` directory and run:

    $ npm install gulp

This will install the base requirement of Gulp. Once this is complete, run:

    $ npm install

This will install all of the node modules (listed in `packages.json`) that are necessary to run the Gulp tasks.
